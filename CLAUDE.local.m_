## Local Environment Paths
If the project folder is named "aif" AIs have problems with the aif/aif/... path names. Therefore, we need to make it
specific here. <PRJ_PATH_ROOT> needs to be replaced! (AND THEN DELETE THIS LINE)

**Project Base Directory**: `<PRJ_PATH_ROOT>`

**Important Path Note**: 
- The project structure contains `<PRJ_PATH_ROOT>/aif/` 
- This is correct: the first `/aif/` is the project base directory, the second `/aif/` is the main project folder
- Therefore, paths like `<PRJ_PATH_ROOT>/aif/ai_analytics/` are correct and expected.
